            In the year 2095, scientist Dr. Elena Voss discovers an ancient artifact hidden beneath the Arctic ice that can transport consciousness through time. When a mysterious organization learns of her discovery, Elena must make the hardest decision of her life: destroy the artifact and condemn humanity to a bleak future, or entrust it to a group of teenagers who believe they can rewrite history. As Elena guides them through dangerous temporal rifts and encounters younger versions of herself, she realizes that some echoes from the past are meant to guide us toward a better tomorrow. With time literally running out and reality beginning to fracture around them, Elena and her unlikely team must navigate treacherous timelines to prevent a catastrophic event that could erase humanity from existence. Every choice they make ripples across decades, and the only way to save the future is to first understand the past.
